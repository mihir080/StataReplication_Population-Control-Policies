# Replication Of "Population Control Policies and Fertility Convergence"
 
### STATA Replication of "Population Control Policies and Fertility Convergence" - de Silva & Tenreyro 2017


Welcome to the GitHub repository for the replication code of the paper titled "The Role of Population Control Policies in Fertility Decline: A Global Perspective." This paper explores the impact of concerted population control policies on the decline in fertility rates across developing countries over the past few decades. It argues that while socioeconomic factors contribute to fertility decline, population control policies have played a central role in shaping the timing and speed of this decline. The repository contains the replication code to reproduce the analyses and findings presented in the paper.

### _Fertility Histograms Over Time_

These graphs serve as a compelling visual narrative of the evolving distribution of Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over time. As discussed previously in Q4, the distribution noticeably skews towards higher values, with outliers exerting a pull on the mean global TFR, which initially resided at the higher end. However, following the implementation of policy interventions, particularly in the 1970s, there was a discernible shift in the distribution. This shift became more pronounced in the 1980s and 1990s, indicating a concentrated movement of countries towards lower average TFRs.

The panel structure of the graphs provides an effective means to capture the nuanced changes in global fertility rates from 1960 to 2013. It allows for a clear visualization of the shifting mean and median values, as well as the changing concentration of TFR values over time. This visual representation not only aligns with the findings of the study but also offers a tangible depiction of the timeline of policy interventions and their estimated impact across different periods. Overall, the graphs serve as a robust validation of the study's conclusions and enhance our understanding of the dynamic nature of global fertility trends.

### _Fertility Trends Across Regions_

The graph illustrates the downward trajectory of fertility rates across regions from 1960 to 2013. North America exhibits a notable decline followed by stabilization, while Europe and Central Asia show a relatively stable but decreasing trend. Similarly, South Asia and Latin America experience a gradual decline over the study period. In contrast, the Middle East and Africa demonstrate a substantial decline, particularly after 1980. Notably, Sub-Saharan Africa, while showing a declining trend, maintains a significantly higher fertility rate compared to other regions.

An intriguing observation is the reversal in policy direction for regions like Europe and Central Asia, which, having reached a nadir in the 2000s, have shifted towards expansionary policies aimed at boosting fertility by the 2010s. This dynamic underscores the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors, policy interventions, and fertility trends, highlighting the need for nuanced approaches to address demographic shifts across different regions.

### _Fertility–Income Relation in 1960 and 2013_
<br>
<img width="720" alt="Figure3" src="https://github.com/mihir080/replication_Population-Control-Policies-and-Fertility-Convergence/assets/64729286/6c52dee1-5217-44b3-a116-a1411d200e30">

Figure 3 presents the correlation between the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and real GDP per capita for the years 1960 and 2013, accompanied by fitted lines for both periods. The notable decline in the relationship between fertility and income over this time span is evident, with women in 2013 having, on average, two fewer children compared to women in 1960 at similar levels of development. This decline mirrors the global trend, with fertility dropping by 2.5 children per woman during this period.

Of particular significance in Figure 3 is the rate of fertility decline among countries with comparable levels of development. Countries with higher GDPs, indicative of greater development, exhibit a relatively modest drop in fertility, around 1 child or even less, from 1960 to 2013. In contrast, developing or underdeveloped countries with lower GDPs experience a substantial decline of nearly 2.5 children. This observed relationship between declining fertility rates and increased income has been extensively studied, notably by Coale in 1969. Figure 3 provides a visual confirmation of this phenomenon, emphasizing the nuanced interplay between economic development and demographic trends on a global scale.

### _Evolution of Fertility Rates by Policy in 1976_
<br>
<img width="720" alt="Figure4" src="https://github.com/mihir080/replication_Population-Control-Policies-and-Fertility-Convergence/assets/64729286/99d68ff2-0654-4f20-95a8-88235edf018d">

The graphs provide a comparative analysis of country-level mean fertility rates based on the stated fertility policy goals in 1976. It vividly illustrates the profound impact of adopting fertility policy goals, particularly evident in countries that implemented measures to reduce fertility, where significant declines in fertility rates are observed.

Interestingly, a consistent global trend of gradual reduction in fertility rates is observed across countries with varying policy interventions. Even in countries where no specific policy intervention was enacted, fertility rates tend to converge toward global levels over time. This convergence is particularly striking across most policy types, with the exception of countries aiming to 'Maintain' fertility rates.

Remarkably, even in countries with a policy goal to maintain fertility rates, there is a discernible downward trend in mean fertility rates, aligning with broader global movements. This observation underscores the dynamic and interconnected nature of fertility trends, suggesting a degree of alignment with global demographic shifts irrespective of specific policy objectives.

### _Fertility and Urbanization_

Figure 5 depicts the relationship between urban population proportion and total fertility rate (TFR) for all countries in 1960 and 2013. It highlights a negative correlation between urbanization and fertility rates, indicating that countries with lower urbanization tend to have higher fertility rates. However, the graph suggests that urbanization alone cannot fully account for the significant decline in fertility rates observed over the past five decades. Instead, the majority of the decline is attributed to factors beyond urbanization, with urbanization contributing to only about 14% of the fertility decline.
